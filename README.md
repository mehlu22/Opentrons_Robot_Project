# Opentrons_Robot_Project
This repository contains the python files for the summer opentrons robot project. It contains all the files starting from the python test code to get the robot functioning and working. In addition to this the repository also contains files in order to implement all the required protocols by the robot starting with the COVID-19 mRNA and 3' mRNA next generation sequencing. It includes additional protocols that have been used as reference to implement a set of functions such as parsing csv files into the code, json files imports, and flashing the lights of the robot in case the protocol and the robot need to be paused due to a run time error or replacing equiptment in the robot.
